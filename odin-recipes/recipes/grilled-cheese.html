        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for <br>
            just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy <br>
            to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste <br>
            preferences and, if you like, you can substitute 
            mayonnaise for butter. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a <br>
            wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp <br>
            Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another <br>
            classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese <br>
            â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese <br>
            pull. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, <br>
            Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Served along side a big bowl of hearty tomato soup, <br>
            the grilled cheese is a tasty lunch! <br>
