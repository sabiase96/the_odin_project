        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from <br>
            the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively <br>
            tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: <br>
            Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive <br>
            compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from <br>
            marination. <br>
