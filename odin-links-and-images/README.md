# The Odin Project - Links and Images

In this project, I learned how to work with links and images. I 
learned how to put links and images in my website with the anchor
and image tags. I learned about the four different kinds of images 
commonly used in websites which are:

    - .jpg
    - .png
    - .gif
    - .svg 

I also learned how to use the href attribute to link other websites 
or images to the anchor and image tags.
