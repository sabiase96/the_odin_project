            <h2>JPG images are good for photos.</h2>
            <img src="images/mochi.png" alt="mochi">
            <p>
                JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes <br>
                without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them <br>
                great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. <br>
                On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels, <br>
                which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you <br>
                look real close: <br>

            <h2>GIFs are good for animations.</h2>
            <img src="images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi">
            <p>
                GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade <br> 
                off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never <br>
                use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for <br>
                GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. This can make <br>
                it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. <br>
                For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you <br>
                don’t need animation. <br>

            <h2>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</h2>
            <img src="images/mochi.png" alt="mochi">
            <p>
                PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. For photos, <br>
                a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would <br>
                generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do <br>
                deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations. <br> 
                This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc. <br>

            <h2>SVGs are <strong>amazing</strong>use them whenever you can</h2>
            <img src="images/svg-vs-png.png" alt="svg-vs-png">
            <p>
                These 300×300 pixel images were originally 100×100 pixels, but scaling <br>
                them up clearly shows the difference between them. Notice the crisp, <br>
                clean lines on the left SVG image, while the PNG image on the right is <br>
                now very pixelated. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite being a vector format, SVGs can be used exactly like their <br>
                raster counterparts. Go ahead and add the mochi.svg to our images.html page: <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently <br>
                across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your <br>
                image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain a <br>
                lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a <br>
                big impact on file size. For this reason, InternetingIsHard.com uses PNGs <br>
                instead of SVGs, even though SVGs are so awesome. <br>
